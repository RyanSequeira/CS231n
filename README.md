# Small Note on Package Versions
Given that the template code for this project was written in 2017, there is a specific window of versions to be used for essential Python packages. I have listed the versions of some key packages for this course because I spent much more time than it should have taken to manage dependencies.

I used the following packages with Python 3.6.10: 
* cython 0.26.1
* jupyter 1.0.0
* matplotlib 2.0.0
* jupyter 1.0.0
* numpy 1.11.3
* pillow 6.1.0
* scipy 1.2.1
* future 0.18.2
